Here they are.

## FYI
- Add `--enable-logging` to the launch arguments to see silent / non-fatal errors.
- Edit `<yoursteaminstall>\SteamApps\common\Cookie Clicker\resources\app\start.js` and change `let DEV=false;` on line 7 to be `let DEV=true;` to get chrome devtools.

## Installing
1. [Download this repository](https://github.com/EntranceJew/cookie-clicker-workshop-mods/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract the files somewhere.
3. Move the folders of the mods you want into `<yoursteaminstall>\SteamApps\common\Cookie Clicker\resources\app\mods\local`, you can get to this from the mods menu.
4. Enable them in-game with the mods menu.
